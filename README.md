# CarProject
OOP class semester project
There are a total of seven pages on the project.
 I plan to complete, debugg and pefect all the code from each page by week.
 So every week I plan to complete 1 page. 
 This means that by about mid-october I should be done. 
 
 My availability to work on this project consist of weeekends and Wednesdays after my service learning hours and before your class. (1:15-4:00) 
 
 
 Itt looks like I was able to upload this manually file by file. My computer keeps glitching when trying to import to my project to GitHub, this same thing was happening with the Hello world project I am going to bring it in to either the IT department at the school or one of your TA's for help Wednesday.
 
 
 This is the meesage intelliJ gives me
