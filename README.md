# CarProject
OOP class semester project
There are a total of seven pages on the project.
 I plan to complete, debugg and pefect all the code from each page by week.
 So every week I plan to complete 1 page. 
 This means that by about mid-october I should be done. 
 
 My availability to work on this project consist of weeekends and Wednesdays after my service learning hours and before your class. (1:15-4:00)
